## Description
The MATLAB program's objective is to demonstrate queue theory and the effect of different arrival rates. The program first starts out by running a simulation for a selected number of time slots and a given arrival rate with a fixed departure rate. This is then plotted to show the length of the queue over time. The simulated results are then compared to the theoretical results in the graph below.
